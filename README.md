# AlgoVista

**Unveiling Sorting and Pathfinding through Visuals**

[**Live Demo**](https://git-raghav.github.io/AlgoVista/)

**AlgoVista** is an interactive web application that visualizes various sorting and pathfinding algorithms. Built for learners and enthusiasts, this project helps users understand complex algorithms through intuitive visual representations.

## Features

-   **Sorting Algorithms Visualization:**
    -   Bubble Sort
    -   Merge Sort
    -   Quick Sort
    -   Insertion Sort
    -   Selection Sort
    -   More coming soon!
-   **Interactive Interface:** Real-time visualization with customizable speed controls and array sizes.
-   **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Supports modern browsers for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   **Backend & Algorithms:** Java (in progress), JavaScript
-   **Cloud Services:** Deployment pending
-   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub for project management

## Future Development

-   **Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization:**
    Coming soon! We are working on exciting features to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms like A\*, Dijkstra, and more.

-   **Custom inputs:**
    Users can add their own inputs and visualize them.

-   **Custom algorithms:**
    Users especially researchers can add their own algorithms and visualize them.

-   **Java-based Algorithm Implementations:**
    Currently migrating the algorithms to Java for backend functionality and enhanced performance.

-   **Deployment:**
    Final deployment is in progress. Stay tuned for updates!
